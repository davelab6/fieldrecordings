			Sounds of Europeʼ in detail </br>

			1. exchanging artistic projects & ideas
			On the one hand the project is about creating a platform for sound oriented organizations, based in Europe, and sound artists, working with field recordings. The platform will be developed during this two-year-project, with the intention of continuing to function afterwards. By ʻplatformʼ we mean a place and opportunity for collaboration, expression and exchange of ideas.
			As a means for collaboration, the platform will literally create a ʻstageʼ for events and activities (e.g. the Earzoomfestival and Sound Exchange Workshops). The activities will be set up together with artists and diverse associated partners each with their own specificities, experiences and networks (see part B). We aim not only to encourage the mobility of cultural workers and artists
			but also to reach a larger audience. For this reason the ʻstageʼ will also get an important virtual component in the ʻSounds of Europeʼ website, not only to report the events in image and sound,but also to host specific web projects (i.e. "Around Europe").
			As a place for exchanging thoughts and ideas, the platform wants to bring together artists and musicians, as well as software developers, scientists, researchers and students, to exchange their experiences, results and understanding of sound and listening. To make these exchanges useful and practical, for the whole practice of field recording and sound research, initially the ideas will be implemented on the ʻSounds of Europeʼ website, followed by a symposium which will take place in Tate Modern in London, and furthermore a publication will be made by CRISAP (London) (see part B). The platform will also have a strong virtual presence to encourage the growth of a real community across borders.
			Hereby, an interdisciplinary approach to sound is inevitable, as field recording is a technique used by a wide array of people and professions (e.g. sound designers, multi-media artists, musicians, scientists, researchers, etc). The platform aims to be a place for these different disciplines to be cross-pollinated and also to contribute to innovation in areas other than cultural sectors.
			
			2. exchanging sounds across borders
			On the other hand the project aims to stimulate a collaborative creation and exploration of the European soundscape, which can contribute to an enhancement of peopleʼs imagination and sensitivity to sounds, and an openness to their and othersʼ environments and cultures.
			
				2.1. Exploration: from learning to listen, to traveling through Europe “Music is an aesthetic perception/understanding/conception of sound. Attaining this musical state requires a profound listening, an immersion in the inside of sound matter.” (Francisco Lopez, sound artist, Spain) “With the work of field recording always comes a travel, a shift or movement that also shifts the conditions of perception.”(Pali Meursault, field recordist, France)
				It is necessary to consider field recording not only for its sounds, but also for the effects the recordings produce: sounds are emotive and an affective investment is made by listening. Field recording is an ideal means by which the individual can come to a greater sense of the art of listening. Certainly, the ear has given way to the eye as the most important gatherer of environmental information, as visual culture is dominating Western thought, perception, and imagination.
				In the perspective of sound education, we aim to encourage people in training to listen, as listening is not only a receptive and passive mode but an active method of exploration, a mode of “walking” through the soundscape/soundwork. In listening one imagines the world. Listening as an aesthetic practice challenges how we see and how we participate in the production of the
				visual world, and repositions us as designers of our own environment. The artistry of field recording lies precisely in the ability to place us directly and immediately within the complex and interconnected sonic environment, for which a detailed explanatory introduction is unnecessary for the general public to find engagement with it. In order to let people discover their own and otherʼs sonic worlds, we will organise events such as Deep Listening (sessions by Pauline Oliveros), and Around Europe, a soundscape-journey on the website (see part B). These projects which have a more pedagogical activity related to field recording, at the same time can trigger discovery of more activities and events in the framework of the project.
					
				2.2. Creation and exchange of sounds
				“Field recording can be like photography: while the composer isnʼt actually creating the sounds, through the complex but often hidden decisions involved in framing it, the work might be highly expressive. Field recordings are carefully knitted and dovetailed, governed by the pre-compositional strategies of a graphic score.” (Michael Pisaro, composer, USA) “Investigating places and environments with microphones (instead of cameras) has this amazing transformative and imaginative power to take you to another place, and when you do that, the pictures become redundant. You donʼt need the image because our imaginations are so much better. It stimulates the imagination. The idea of investigating places with microphones suddenly becomes incredibly liberating. They have their own eloquence and language, which is a very powerful creative process.” (Chris Watson, sound recordist, UK) Amongst the conceptual forebears of the art of field recording are not only John Cage but also the Fluxus movement. They have proclaimed that, depending on how we look at it, the world can be art, or vice versa, that by proclaiming the world as art we recognise and become aware of it. In a perspective of social creativity (the interaction between individuals and their environments), the project aims to set up workshops, introducing participants to different ways of thinking and working with sounds, and making known the technologies that make it possible, suggesting creative procedures towards finishing the workshop with an artistic project (see part B).
				The workshops will take place in schools, libraries and civic centers in different places within Europe (in collaboration with specialised associated partners Aifoon, Sounds from Denmark and Sonic Postcards) and participants of the workshops will share their recorded sounds with participants from other countries to build together a European sound map. As sounds are a universal language, the playful chance of exchange will be at the same time both an intercultural exchange amongst participants from all ages, and an opportunity to sense and grow a European connection.
