		General concept and objectives of the project
		</div>
In 1973, the Canadian composer and theorist R. Murray Schafer stated that the ʻblurring of the
edges between music and environmental sounds is the most striking feature of twentieth
century musicʼ. 
<div class="writings_titre">
		Definition
		</div>
Certainly the definition of music had been undergoing radical change around
that same time. In another contemporaneous definition, John Cage declared: “Music is sounds,
sounds heard around us whether weʼre in or out of concert halls”.

		Source and ties
		</div>
From the technological point of view it was sound recording that had altered the very
nature of music. With the invention of electroacoustic equipment, music could be detached from
both its source and its ties to any particular setting and location. 
<div class="writings_titre">
		New sound-shaping and space-making devices
		</div>
Since the early seventies,  were being made available, with which new sonic
worlds could be created, working with the plastic, aesthetic and poetic qualities of sounds. In this
way the process of making music moved much closer to the process of painting. 
<div class="writings_titre">
		Insertions
		</div>
Since it became possible to insert any sound from the environment into a musical composition,
the microphone itself, for many artists, became a musical instrument.

		Abstractions and patterns
		</div>
	 The practice of audio and sound recording in the outside world (e.g. in a forest, a pedestrian crossing, or an empty space et
al.), as opposed to that which is done within the studio environment, is known as ʻfieldrecordingʼ. Field recording has become a medium in a wide range of diverse artistic domains,
and is now commonly encountered both as a distinct artistic practice and as a component of music and sound art.
